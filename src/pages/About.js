        Hi, my name is Dmitry Lubyagin/Ursa and I am a Russian web developer
        with experience in front-end. Also, i love design
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve had my first splash into web development when I was 14 - Iâ€™ve
        beenan admin of a Russian website with flash games for girls (

        itâ€™s still running, though, some sections seem bugged). I was doing some
        CSS, HTML, PHP work. Even though i didnâ€™t know what i was doing, i was
        able to understand it the more iâ€™ve done it - this is where my love of
        coding began. Ever since I have been curious about how websites work,
        which pushed me to my development career ðŸ¤”
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am developing websites and searching for interesting projects and
        work positions. <b className="color-cyan">Hire me!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer the front-end development, but also can do back-end since my
        freelance work always has to do something with setting up the server and
        making server scripts work.
